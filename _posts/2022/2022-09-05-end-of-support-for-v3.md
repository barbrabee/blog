[Chevereto V3](https://releases.chevereto.com/3.X/) has been a successful major version which has been delivering service for lots years, but its age starts to show. [Chevereto V3 LTS](../2019/2019-11-08-chevereto-3-long-term-support.md) has been around long already and it got extended one extra year due the pandemic. It has been a superb release, but we need to move on.

After **3161 days** (*8 years, 7 months, 25 days*) since [V3.0.0](https://releases.chevereto.com/3.X/3.0/3.0.0.html), Chevereto V3 support will end on **2022-11-30**.

## Services affected

End of support means that we will stop providing the following services for Chevereto V3 licenses:

- Bug Tracking

- Purchase upgrade to V4
- Access to downloads prior V3.20

As there won't be any support included, Chevereto V3 will be removed from our catalog and we will stop selling Chevereto V3 on **2022-09-30**.

By **2022-11-30** (end of support) Chevereto V3 licenses won't be able to upgrade to Chevereto V4. If you still don't upgrade your Chevereto V3 license we encourage you to consider upgrading to Chevereto V4 before this date.
