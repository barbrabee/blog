Chevereto's milestone V4.0 aka **Macanudo** has reached production grade with [Chevereto V4.0.0](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.0/4.0.0.html) after [one year](../2021/2021-09-24-chevereto-macanudo.md) of beta driven development.

## Demo

Try Chevereto V4.0 at the [demo website](https://demo.chevereto.com). Get a demo anywhere with [Docker](https://github.com/chevereto/v4-docker).

## Highlights

Chevereto V4.0 adds most-wanted features like user-based API, theme palettes, faster rendering, keyboard shortcuts, mobile improvements, CSAM protection, folder upload, two-factor auth, REPL and more.

Learn all about the new features at [Macanudo (4.0)](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/introduction/changelog/4.0.html) change-log and at [Chevereto 4](https://rodolfoberrios.com/2022/09/20/chevereto-4/) for a detailed development perspective for this major release.

## Release date

Chevereto V4.0.0 goes public on 2022-09-30.

## Upgrade from Chevereto V3

We have step-by-step instructions for [upgrading to Chevereto V4.0](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/application/installing/upgrading.html). Upgrade service available at [Extra Support](https://chevereto.com/support) layer where you get the software upgraded by the author himself, can't beat that.

### Limited time offer

Chevereto V3 license upgrade to Chevereto V4 will be available for a limited time until **2022-11-30**. After that date a new Chevereto V4 license purchase will be required.

### What if I don't upgrade?

[Chevereto V3 EOL](2022-09-05-end-of-support-for-v3.md) happens at the [same time](https://v3-docs.chevereto.com/get-started/status.html) of PHP 7.4 EOL. Systems running Chevereto V3 will stop getting support at both application and language layers, and the only support available will be these provided by Linux-based distributions like Debian, Ubuntu or RedHat which is not the same type of support.

Outdated systems may keep servicing for some years, but it will spawn an ever increasing cost for system management as the market abandons the old tech. From a security point of view, outdated Chevereto systems could be exposed to threats that may be constantly appearing with time.

We will keep offering Extra Support and Community Help for these old systems.
