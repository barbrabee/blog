This is the first issue of **Chevereto Tiempos**, a monthly recap for all-things Chevereto. We build these notes taking in consideration announcements, user submitted tips, and tech news around self-hosting and related software products.

## V4.0.0.beta.5

The new beta is available, check the [release notes](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.0/4.0.0.beta.5.html) and the [release announcement](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-5-announcement.14006/) to learn more.

üíñ This beta introduces new beautiful theme palettes for and more user interface improvements. It includes the brand new [XR Debugger](#xr-debugger).

## V4.0.0.beta.6

Chevereto V4.0.0.beta.6 has been [announced](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-6.14081/). We are getting close to production-ready release, stay tuned.

## XR Debugger

We've created a [lightweight PHP debugger](https://rodolfo.is/2022/01/06/hello-xr/) at [chevere/xr](https://github.com/chevere/xr) which is now built-in in Chevereto V4. This will dramatically improve how users debug Chevereto installations, making any code editing and troubleshooting easier to resolve.
