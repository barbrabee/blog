## V4's manuals

As you may have noticed, for V4 we have been working a lot in improving the new [V4 Documentation](https:///v4-docs.chevereto.com/). Traditionally, our documentation has been focused in get the system running. This changes with V4 and we are pleased to introduce the all-new user manuals.

👏 You can now consume [V4 Admin manual](https://v4-user.chevereto.com/) for everything admin related. There's also the [V4 User manual](https://v4-user.chevereto.com/) (early work-in-progress).

## Chevereto.cloud

Our cloud platform at [chevereto.cloud](https://chevereto.cloud/) is starting to become real. During the past couple of months we have been preparing everything to get this ready as V4 goes production.

You can [pre-register](https://forms.gle/PTKDXEXL3Rca3LjV7) to ensure your seat (limited availability!) and be among the firsts to try our exclusive cloud offering.
