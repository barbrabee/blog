## V4.0.0.beta.8

Chevereto V4.0.0.beta.8 has been [released](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8.14246/) and it drops massive new features to Chevereto.

üëâ Check the complete release notes at [releases.chevereto.com](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.0/4.0.0.beta.8.html).

### ü¶Ñ Added expiration date

Expiration time is now visible on [main upload form](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71183), same as category and album. With this you can now easily bulk set the expiration date for your current upload.

### ‚úÖ Improved API authorization

Authorization in API V1.1 gets improved with support for [header authorization](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/api/api-v1.html#authorization). Instead of passing key in the body you will now be able to pass the X-API-Key header with the target API key.

### ü¶Ü Improved login page

Login [now uses](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71236) accent color for the submit button (arrow icon). Autofilled account details (username, password) now follow the palette color as it overrides the browser defaults.

### üíÖ Improved uploader UX

The uploader [has been improved](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71234) for iOS devices (missing upload button, not rounded borders), also the fixed uploader now blocks the page scrolling in the background when opened.

### üí° Improved autofocus behavior

Property autofocus [has been added](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71277) to form elements at login, signup and account/*. This will focus the user input with a blinking text on page load. This saves one click and makes the experience a little bit better.

### üíÖ Improved consent screen

Consent screen [gets improved](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71090) with a neat new design.

### üé© Improved mobile top bar

Mobile top bar [now shows](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71184) uploader instead of notifications, which are now under the menu (hamburger icon).

### üòé Improved API guest user handling

Calls to API V1.1 using the public key at Dashboard > API will [now be handled](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71231) as guest uploads, meaning that it follows all guest upload restrictions you may want to configure (enabled, guest max upload file size, etc).

### üõ§ SEO route options settings

This is minimal change, but is quite annoying to don't have the routing settings on the same place. This [get fixed in V4](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-0-beta-8-announcement.14194/post-71079) and now SEO routing settings are under Dashboard > Settings > Routing.
