Chevereto turns 14 and for this anniversary we got many neat announcements and project updates to share.

## Recap

A lot of things have been happening and this is the recap of all the new stuff we already got now:

### Chevereto V3.20 LTS

We made a final release for V3.X LTS to push its EOL up to April 2025. This is the most mature V3 release and it will coexist with V4 to enable our users a smooth transition to V4 without any pressure.

Keep in mind that V4 is a **progressive development** release, while V3.20 is the **production-grade** material. You can use both editions, it all depends on the context use you want to give to it.

### Vultr partnership

We now officially provide Chevereto one-click provisioning at the [Vultr Marketplace](https://chv.to/vultr)! How awesome? This is the easier way to get your Chevereto running on your own premises, it will take you one-click and sixty seconds of your time to get Chevereto running there.

We can't stress how much we are happy with Vultr and as a matter of fact we are already migrating all our infra there. We will be dropping all our existing providers in favour of Vultr because we feel strongly supported by them and the machines are a delight.

_Many thanks [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/), Chevereto_ ðŸ’– _you._

### releases.chevereto.com

We now have a dedicated system at [releases.chevereto.com](https://releases.chevereto.com/) to publish our ongoing releases, enabling users to easily browse the release changes.

With this we seek to provide the release notes more easily to consume so users can be aware of the important version changes and what they are missing due to outdated software, specially security wise.

**Dear user:** Kindly update your software to avoid any potentially issue damaging your system integrity.

### Chevereto.comÂ translations

Chevereto.com is now available in 11 different languages, which has allowed us to reach more users than before. You are welcome to help us with your translation, keep contributing so nobody gets excluded just because of a language barrier.

Check translations at [chevereto.oneskyapp.com](https://chevereto.oneskyapp.com/collaboration/project?id=381522)

### Containers

With V3.20 we got native support for containers and Chevereto is now a 12-factor app that can be easily deployed in any infra. This is really big for the software, it allow us to run really _anywhere_.

This is still green, we know that the market isn't ready yet but the exceptional early results and the ease to manage instances is golden for us. Is just matter of time for this taking the mainstream and we can't wait to see how our software takes the place it deserves.

## Introducing Chevereto.cloud

The special announcement this year is [Chevereto.cloud](https://chevereto.com/cloud), our very own hosted offering. We are already getting [pre-registrations](https://forms.gle/PTKDXEXL3Rca3LjV7) for it, you can sign up now.

With Chevereto cloud we want to make Chevereto more accessible than ever by erasing all the server hassles and the technical knowledge barrier required to enjoy our software.

## Mobile application

And for the _one more thing moment_, we are creating a cross-platform universal Chevereto V4 API mobile client!

As V4 will finally provide us with a compelling user based API, we can now roll our very own official mobile application, which will be an universal API client for any Chevereto V4 API and any end-user of any Chevereto V4 instance (cloud, on-premise) will be able to use this application.

We can't wait to disclose more details in the following months, as you may noticed this year the announcements are getting more interesting.

## Thank you!

Chevereto turns 14 all thanks to its loyal users, we really thank you for another great year for us.

_Â¡Larga vida al Chevereto!_
