Is about time to reinvigorate Chevereto, I took some time to build our new foundations and you waited patiently. I'm glad, thanks for your support. It's payday!

Today I'm announcing a very bold road map that will unveil many great releases and important project updates for the years to come.

More importantly, this is the first time for the project where we will be offering two major editions as we will market V3 LTS for production systems while V4 will be our ahead preview. This will enable us to offer both production grade software and development previews.

## Chevereto V3.20: May 2021

Chevereto V3.20 (coqueto) culminates the project work within 2013-2021 and is the final version for Chevereto V3. It was about time to end V3 with a big release, to close this chapter of the project the best way possible.

_Read [Chevereto V3.20 &#8220;coqueto&#8221; announcement](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v3-20-coqueto-announcement.13132/)._

This release features a massive user interface update, support for containers, improved performance and top reliability. Coqueto improves in everything required to mature Chevereto V3 and it will keep getting active maintenance until **November 2022** to match with PHP 7.4 eol.

V3.20 was built on top of **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** so you will be able to run V3.20 based production systems until **April 2025**.

## Chevereto V4.0: September 2021

The release of Chevereto V4 (macanudo) will happen in September 2021 and it evolves right from coqueto. Chevereto V4 will require PHP 8 and it will carry a heavy development cycle.

Macanudo will feature extended social login support and user based API. This is a huge change as it makes the default user interface exactly that: A default, enabling your users to use your service from anywhere.

## Chevereto V4 release cycle

All V4 releases will be named and will get released twice per year (March and September).

Chevereto V4 updates will be all about progressively improve on everything and I'm confirming at least five revisions for this major version.
