The documentation has been improved, you can check it right now at: [v3-docs.chevereto.com](https://v3-docs.chevereto.com/), now automatically sourced from [chevereto/docs](https://github.com/chevereto/docs) so it is fresh as it gets.

🧙🏾 Try pushing a change, the website gets deployed automatically. _Is magic!_

The new documentation is made with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), hosted at [github](https://github.com/chevereto/v3-docs), and delivered as a progressive web application (PWA) which you can install in your devices for offline usage. It also uses Algolia's [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).

Certainly you will notice how fast it is. Also: Collaborative 😘, feel free to help improving it!
